I came to the programming party a little late in my [college](http://www.trincoll.edu/Pages/default.aspx) career, 
only having a year and a half of classroom experience under my belt. Due
to my limited CS background, I was rather anxious to start work at a
web development startup, fearing my qualifications were not up to par.
However, my feelings of inadequacy quickly subsided after starting at
DockYard! I was welcomed by a comfortable learning environment and an
atmosphere of positivity and productivity. My coworkers are very
approachable and always willing to answer my questions. Because of
DockYard's intimate size I am able to see all sides of the business, and
get to know everyone in the office.

It has now been a month since I began working and already I feel I am
light-years ahead of where I started. My nerves have been replaced by an
eagerness to continue learning and grow as a developer. The amount of
information that has been thrown my way is rather overwhelming. I have
already pored through 6 books, including: [Agile Web Development with
Rails](http://pragprog.com/book/rails32/agile-web-development-with-rails-3-2) by Sam Ruby and, [Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja](http://jsninja.com/) by John Resig, in
addition to other readings on [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), version control ([git](http://git-scm.com)), and
[user stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Not to mention my introduction to vim and all the commands
that accompany it. While I cannot claim all of the information has
stuck, the exposure will surely breed understanding. I have learned that
it isn't about having all the answers, but the efficiency of finding
them that is important.


In addition to all the reading, I have worked on a small side project: a
simple blog site (my introduction to [test-driven
development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)) that I
rebuilt 3 times, each time adding more features. The saying, "repetition
is the mother of all learning", has certainly resonated with me after
this exercise.  Also [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with others in the office has also
been extremely helpful, giving me an idea of the day-to-day. Overall, I
feel lucky to be at DockYard in the midst of the growing field of web
development. Already I can say my experience has been invaluable and I
thoroughly look forward to the rest of the summer.
