[DockYard](http://dockyard.com) is a Boston-based consultancy that always wants to work with
the best people and the best technology. We are committed to Ember.js as
a client side framework. We help organize the Boston Ember.js meetup and
I recently spoke at [Ember Camp in San Francisco](http://embercamp.com). We are already [building
tools around Ember.js](https://github.com/dockyard/ember-builds) and hope to continue to improve and build new ones
in the upcoming years.

Please email [contact@dockyard.com](mailto:contact@dockyard.com) with

fulltime Ember.js developer.
