This is not a numbers game you want it to be.

In your recent [email to CSAIL](http://pastebin.com/DVysCXPj) you go out
of your way to make a political point about how the number of deaths
recently in Boston pale in comparison to what [recently happened in
Texas](http://www.cnn.com/2013/04/18/us/texas-explosion/index.html). To
that end, yes you are correct. The number `35` is greater than the
number `4`. You go on to point out that car related deaths kill on
average `100` people a day, this would mean since Monday there have been
`500` car related deaths in the United States. So your math works: `500`
is greater than `35` and both are stil greater than `4`. Or in
otherwords your order of precedence is:

1. Annual car related deaths in the United States
2. Chemical plant explosion in Texas
3. Boston Marathon Bomber

That's your list of importance, based solely upon simple math.

You're wrong.

What you conveniently failed to take into account was the first two are
*accidents*. The third was a willful attempt to murder people, and to do
 so with the most visibility possible. The Boston Marathon is the
premiere event in the city, the eyes of the world are upon us and the
Tsarnaev brothers knew this. They methodically carried out a plan. Then
they went back to their normal lives as if nothing happened.

The police response over the past two days not only was to bring justice
but also to show the world that this sort of thing will not be tolerated
in Boston. We will shut down the entire city and hunt these people down
like dogs. At the cost of a $1 Billion/day economy. At the inconvenience
to its population.

The 100 car accidents a day are not planned and for the most part are
unavoidable. The deaths from the explosion in Texas was avoidable and
the result of negligence by really stupid people. In both cases there
are not people that are actively looking to destroy others.

I realize you can't be swayed and I doubt you'll read
this. But let's not kid ourselves, this is just another one of your thinly
veiled attempts to push your anti-establishment agenda. Congratulations
for capitalizing on tragedy for your own purposes. Have a cookie.
