## User Story Writing Basics ##

The goal in writing user stories is to establish a human voice at every step of the development process. This can be a difficult picture for technically minded developers to imagine, who base a majority of their decisions on logic and efficiency. Each story must determine one of the functions that a finalized product will perform while also acknowledging the social and cultural context surrounding that function.

Language can be deceptive in conveying story goals. In the story-carding phase, take measures to eliminate technical jargon that could confuse non-developers. Story cards are only prompts that need to be expanded on through ongoing conversation between users, developers, and other individuals within a carefully selected customer team.

The customer team should reflect the unique functions of the product under development. It operates as the central hub in maintaining the balance between business and tech interests. It should combine thinkers who represent general and targeted user interests with developers and other skilled individuals. This will help direct the development of the product by prioritizing stories based on what users are most interested in seeing in the final product. Additional stories can be prioritized in interactions following initial release based on the extent of desired development.

## 6 Parameters For User Stories ##

1. Each story should be Independent so that product development can be easily broken down and reorganized. Avoid unnecessary entanglement with other stories to maintain flexibility and freedom in the design process.
2. The customer team should make changes and negotiate stories to ensure that all relevant perspectives are acknowledged. This is essential to maintaining an agile development process through multiple iterations.
3. Let the concept behind the technology shine brightest. Use careful phrasing to ensure that users are able to look at the stories and acknowledge how each is valuable to the product experience.
4. Write stories that can be easily calculated. While abstract language may be necessary to communicate technical concepts with users, every story should be rooted in a logical and quantifiable plan for development.
5. Each story is just a unit in a much greater epic. Keep them small to maintain maximum control over the design process and reduce miscalculations in time and cost estimation.
6. Finally, all stories must be testable. There must be a logical set of criteria to designate whether or not a story has achieved its purpose. A rigorous testing plan will reduce long-term costs in maintenance and development.

Some suggested methods for gathering user stories are interviews, questionnaires, observations and story-writing workshops. It is important to note that the best data collection methods should be as diverse as the range of users themselves, encompassing a wide range of information gathering tactics. This will give the customer team a wealth of knowledge to analyze and story-card. Some users might be more assertive about their opinion in an interview with developers while others may prefer story-writing workshops. Take into account the nature of the project itself and what implications it might have for response rate. Users may prefer to respond to some more sensitive subject material through an anonymous questionnaire or survey.

In some circumstances, especially for developers working within limited resources or without a well-organized customer team, user role modeling could help generate a clearer picture for user story formation. Create hypothetical users who reflect real-world populations that are inclined to use the product. It might help to draw up a couple user profiles to address multiple lifestyle-types that the product could be used within. This could be especially helpful in designing products for foreign markets or third world countries where the adoption of technology does not follow the western standard.
